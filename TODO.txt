Create application consisting of 2 panels:
- left panel: list of elements to be displayed on chart (multi selection should be available),
- right panel: chart with data.

Data is available via dataProvider service.
Your code should be well and carefully tested.
You can use whatever you want to create chart.

Good luck!
